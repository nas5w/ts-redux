# Typescript React Redux

This repository accompanies the [Set Up a Typescript React Redux Project](https://typeofnan.dev/setup-a-typescript-react-redux-project/) post and extends the example to a functional app.

To see the app in action, clone it down and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nas5w/ts-redux.git
cd ts-redux
yarn
```

Then, run the app

```bash
yarn start
```
